abstract={People typically exhibit greater sensitivity to losses than to 
equivalent gains when making decisions. We investigated neural correlates of 
loss aversion while individuals decided whether to accept or reject gambles 
that offered a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money. A broad set of areas 
(including midbrain dopaminergic regions and their targets) showed increasing 
activity as potential gains increased. Potential losses were represented by 
decreasing activity in several of these same gain-sensitive areas. Finally, 
individual differences in behavioral loss aversion were predicted by a measure 
of neural loss aversion in several regions, including the ventral striatum and 
prefrontal cortex.},
