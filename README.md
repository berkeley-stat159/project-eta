Fall 2015 group project

Team Member: Jon Jara, Will Sanderson, Juan Shishido, Paul Wu, Wendy Xu

###What is this?

Our group is working on the paper __The Neural Basis of Loss Aversion in Decision-Making Under Risk__, which investigates whether loss aversion reflects the engagement of distinct emotional processes when potential losses are considered and examines the neural systems that process decision utility. The paper can be found in [our project](https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-eta)

The study has 16 subjects (eight males and eight females with an average age of 22). For each of them, three trials of the _mixed gambles task_ are performed and data sets of blood-oxygen-level-dependent are collected and contrasted. The study uses two modeling approaches for the primary whole-brain analyses-- the parametric analysis and the matrix analysis. The paper can be found in [Project-eta](https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-eta).

###What we plan to do?

We plan to reproduce this study based on the whole-brain statistical analysis. We will look into the two modeling approaches that the authors used, and come up with our own approach based on what we have and what we can do.

Here's a couple of things we are heading:

1. Data cleaning, normalization.

2. GLM.

3. Correlate behavioral risk aversion vs neural risk aversion.

4. Multi-voxel pattern analysis
