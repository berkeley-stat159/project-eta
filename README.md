Fall 2015 group project

Team Member: Jon Jara, Juan Shishido, Wendy Xu

###What is this?

Our group is working on the paper __The Neural Basis of Loss Aversion in
Decision-Making Under Risk__, which investigates whether loss aversion reflects
the engagement of distinct emotional processes when potential losses are
considered and examines the neural systems that process decision utility. The
paper can be found in [our project](https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-eta)

The study has 16 subjects (eight males and eight females with an average age of
22). For each of them, three trials of the _mixed gambles task_ are performed
and data sets of blood-oxygen-level-dependent are collected and contrasted. The
study uses two modeling approaches for the primary whole-brain analyses---the
parametric analysis and the matrix analysis. The paper can be found in
[Project-eta](https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-eta).

###What we plan to do?

We plan to reproduce this study based on the whole-brain statistical analysis.
We will look into the two modeling approaches that the authors used, and come
up with our own approach based on what we have and what we can do.

Here are a few things we are doing:

1. Data cleaning, normalization

2. GLM

3. Correlate behavioral risk aversion vs neural risk aversion

4. Multi-voxel pattern analysis
